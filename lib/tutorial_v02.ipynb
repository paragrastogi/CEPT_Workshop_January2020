    "<h2>Uncertainty and Building Simulation</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty in engineering calculations arises from a lack of knowledge about the inputs and parameters of these calculations. In other words, not knowing the inputs to a calculation accurately and precisely affects our ability to know the accuracy of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is an estimate of the (thermal and electrical) energy performance of a building. The usual goal of the design process is to obtain a high-performance design, based on some criteria determined by the designer. However, performance depends on several factors outside of the building design, e.g., weather and usage. In common practice, accurate values of these inputs are either difficult or impossible to obtain. That is, we may have some estimates but we cannot access the true value of some input to our calculation, such as future weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a common way to quantify this uncertainty is to sample ranges of plausible values of uncertain inputs. Simulating with different combinations of plausible input values gives a range of outputs, which is representative of the possible outputs to be expected. Using BPS, for example, \"... designers can obtain reliable performance estimates by testing their designs under many plausible operating conditions, e.g., the weather and usage the building might experience in the future. These estimates can then be used to choose a design that could deliver high performance for the rest of its life...\" (Rastogi, Khan, and Andersen 2018, <i>in review</i>). This is called robust or resilient design. In this workshop, we will work towards the goal of high-performance, robust design with uncertain inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Unfortunately, multiple simulations are time-consuming... Standard averaging methods, such as the Monte Carlo method, typically require a large number of simulations to ensure the quality of the estimate (MacDonald  2002; Iaccarino 2008}. In a typical building-design problem where a designer might test hundreds of designs, such methods might require hundreds of hours to run and quickly become infeasible. A preferred practice is to simply use a single 'average' or 'typical' estimate of future conditions, which is much faster. The danger of such a procedure is that it might miss a harmful operating condition where the building performs poorly or even breaks down. To ensure the robustness of designs it is, therefore, better to test them under a wide variety of plausible operating conditions.\" (Rastogi, Khan, and Andersen 2018, <i>in review</i>)\n",
    "\n",
    "So is it possible to reduce the computation time of BPS such that multiple simulations during the design process are feasible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes it is! With a rapid-response regression model, which we call an 'emulator' (because it emulates the original, physics-based building performance simulation model). A regression model can be used to answer questions about a building's response to changing inputs rapidly, such as may be required by robust design.\n"
