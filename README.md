# Weather and Uncertainty workshop

Hello! Welcome to the world of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods. This repository contains Python scripts and Python-based Jupyter notebooks to accompany Parag Rastogi's seminar and workshop in CEPT University, Ahmedabad, India, on 06 January 2018. 

Here you will find simple examples of uncertainty propagation using Monte Carlo analysis of a simple regression model of a building monthly energy need published in Clarke [1].

Parag is the sole author of these scripts. The scripts are meant to be used for instructional use only - the author does not accept any liability for their use and misuse for other purposes. This repository carries the the GPLv3 license (see the LICENSE file for details).
